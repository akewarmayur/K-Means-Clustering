# K-Means Clustering
## Assignment 4 : 
We have given a collection of 8 points. P1=[0.1,0.6] P2=[0.15,0.71] P3=[0.08,0.9] P4=[0.16,
0.85] P5=[0.2,0.3] P6=[0.25,0.5] P7=[0.24,0.1] P8=[0.3,0.2]. Perform the k-mean clustering
with initial centroids as
m1=P1 =Cluster#1=C1 and m2=P8=cluster#2=C2. Answer the
following
1] Which cluster does P6 belongs to?
2] What is the population of cluster around m2?
3] What is updated value of m1 and m2?
